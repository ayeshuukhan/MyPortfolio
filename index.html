    <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm an AI enthusiast pursuing a Bachelor's in Artificial Intelligence. 
          My core focus lies in solving real-world challenges using deep learning, 
          machine learning, and state-of-the-art AI frameworks. I specialize in 
          Natural Language Processing, working extensively with Neural Networks, CNNs, 
          Transformers, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Agentic AI, and Generative AI systems. 
          I'm passionate about pushing the boundaries of what's possible through intelligent models 
          that impact daily life.

      <h3>Aquavision</h3>
      <p>AquaVision-YOLOv11 is a custom-trained object detection model developed to accurately identify six marine species‚Äîfish, shark, penguin, puffin, starfish, and stingray‚Äîfrom underwater imagery. Leveraging the power of YOLOv11, this model is optimized for real-time performance, making it ideal for applications in marine research, environmental monitoring, and educational tools. With its high accuracy and speed, AquaVision-YOLOv11 contributes to advancing oceanic studies and raising awareness about marine biodiversity.</p>

      <h3>CO‚ÇÇ Emission Estimator</h3>
      <p>This mini project focuses on predicting the carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ) emissions of vehicles using a linear regression model. The dataset used contains model-specific information about fuel consumption and estimated CO‚ÇÇ emissions for new light-duty vehicles available for retail sale in Canada. To ensure consistency across model years, the fuel consumption data from 1995 to 2014 has been adjusted using the 5-cycle testing method. The goal of the project is to analyze the relationship between engine size and CO‚ÇÇ emissions, and to build a predictive model that estimates emissions based on a vehicle‚Äôs engine size.</p>

      <h3>Birds Classification</h3>
      <p>This project implements a bird species classification system using the AlexNet architecture in PyTorch. It involves model training, evaluation on test data, and comprehensive performance analysis through metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, the project includes visualizations such as training loss curves and a confusion matrix to better interpret the model‚Äôs effectiveness and learning behavior.</p>
