  <!-- Project Description -->
  <section class="project-description">
  <p>
    The Prosthetic Arm Control Project is a highly innovative research endeavor aimed at developing intelligent, user-friendly prosthetic limbs that can be controlled through neural and muscular signals using advanced AI models. This project integrates surface Electromyography (sEMG) signals and state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, such as Vision Transformers and gesture recognition algorithms, to enable real-time, intuitive control of artificial limbs. Our goal is to empower individuals with limb differences by offering them natural, accurate, and responsive prosthetic solutions that can be customized for various gestures and actions. 
    <br><br>
    I am working on this project under the esteemed organization 
    <a href="https://ncai.pk/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #5a3fc0;"><strong>National Center of Artificial Intelligence</strong></a>, where I contribute to the software and AI integration for gesture classification and limb movement prediction. This work not only involves AI model development but also real-world testing with devices like the Myo Armband and custom prosthetic hand hardware, ensuring practical application and impact in the field of bioengineering and assistive technology.
